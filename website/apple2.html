            <h2>Apple II, refers to a series of microcomputers produced by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1977 until 1993. The inaugural model, which lent its name to the series, was created by Steve Wozniak and was first available for purchase on June 10, 1977. Its success paved the way for subsequent models, including the Apple II Plus, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, and Apple IIc Plus, with the Apple IIe, released in 1983, achieving the highest popularity. The trademarked name appears with square brackets as Apple ][, and from the IIe onward, it is represented as Apple //.

                The Apple II marked a significant improvement over its predecessor, the Apple I, particularly in user-friendliness, features, and expandability. It emerged as one of the most recognized and successful computers of the 1980s, primarily within the United States. The computer was aggressively marketed to educational institutions through volume discounts and manufacturing partnerships, making it the first widely adopted computer in American secondary schools, surpassing the earlier leader, Commodore PET. The development of educational and business software for the Apple II, including the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet released in 1979, contributed to its appeal among business users and families alike.</h2>
